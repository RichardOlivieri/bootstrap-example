# bootstrap-example
I made an example BootStrap webpage. It utilizes HTML coding and some CSS. I played around with various BootStrap templates, navbars with search functions, jumbotron headers, alert messages, columns, buttons, containers for different tables, user data tables, input boxes, Buttons, and User logins.
